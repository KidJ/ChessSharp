Tasks

Create board with initial state
Move a piece on the board, creating a new board state

Write function to generate legal moves for a piece type, assuming empty board.

Make a move and update the board position.

Architectural thoughts

Emphasise functional paradigm, immutable data structures and mathematical functions preferred over any performance concerns.

Piece

Square
    - 

Board state - Immutable. Contains pieces within a squares.
theres the space of all potential chess board layouts, and we have a function move which produces another board state
Move state - extra info about what moves are legal, e.g. en passant, castling
Game state

Move
A move by a player. Can be legal or illegal based on Game state.

Pieces
- legal moves for each piece, given current board state
- different types of each piece
- values

Game over conditions
- checkmate - are we in check, and is the king in check in all other possible next moves for the other player
- perpetual
- 50 moves without piece taken
